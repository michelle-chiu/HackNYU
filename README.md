<h1>NYU-Connect</h1>

<p>NYU-Connect was my team's submission for the HackNYU hackathon; it is a web application that allows NYU students to connect with one another: to find roommates, new prospective friends, concert buddies, etc. Our website matches people based on their favorite genre of music and also through Spotify. In our app, users are anonymous to one another--you only share who you are if you feel willing to. A unique feature of the private chat is that the chat spawns a topic to start the conversation.</p>
